Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,"I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",Closed with explanation
Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,"An account on my credit report has a mistaken date. I mailed in a debt validation letter to allow XXXX to correct the information. I received a letter in the mail, stating that Experian received my correspondence and found it to be   suspicious '' and that   I did n't write it ''. Experian 's letter is worded to imply that I am incapable of writing my own letter. I was deeply offended by this implication. 
I called Experian to figure out why my letter was so suspicious. I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. 
I am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.",Closed with explanation

Debt collection,Credit card,Taking/threatening an illegal action,"I am writing to request your assistance in looking into the deceptive practices of this collection law-firm above. It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. 

1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ).

5.

Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure","I went through a divorce several years ago and requested a home loan modification through Bank of America. Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and   hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process.

Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","Select Portfolio Servicing has been deceptive and intimidating. It has been difficult for me to find my past due balance. I missed a regular monthly payment. When I attempted to make a payment to try to get caught up I could not find my past due balance. My printed statement listed a past due balance, but it did not list a payment that I had made prior to the statement being generated. My online account did not list a past due balance at all. It only told me that I had a regular monthly payment due. It also did not list any late fees or other fees of any kind. I then received a letter stating that my mortgage was now in default. This confused me even more because neither my statement or online account had any information about my loan being in default. Also, I did n't think my loan could be in default because I was approximately 30 days past due. I called SPS. When I called and entered in my account information, I was greeted by an audio recording stating that I had a regular monthly payment due. The recording made no reference to a past due balance or to my loan being in default or to any fees that may be due. I selected the option to speak with a representative. Prior to speaking with a representative I was greeted by another recording stating that I was about to speak with a   debt collector '' and that any information given would be used in order to   collect on a debt ''. At this point I felt SPS was deliberately trying to confuse and intimidate me. Is SPS a mortgage loan servicer or a debt collector? Is my account in default or past due? What is my past due balance? The rep I spoke with was polite, but not helpful. I did finally get my current past due balance. However, I was threatened with   legal action '' if my account was not made current with in 6 days. I was not given an answer to why my online account does not reflect my past due balance, is my loan in default or past due, why do I have to pay {$15.00} to make an online payment, why did my interest rate go up. Furthermore, I was given unclear answers about what kind of a company SPS is ( mortgage loan servicer or debt collector ), why do they use intimidating language both in documents and over the phone, is SPS purposefully trying to confuse me. I acknowledge that I am past due on my payments, but it should not be this difficult to find my past due balance and I should not be threatened and intimidated.",Closed with explanation
